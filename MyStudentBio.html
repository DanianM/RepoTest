		I am a 25 year old student, currently attending UCSD. My passions lay in technology, sports, exercise, and just life in general. I was born and raised in <br> Germany until the age of 10. Since then, I have resided in Northern California, known as the Bay Area and Silicon Valley. I am trilingual, highly 
		<br>proficient in English, German, and Farsi. I believe in the love, peace, and respect of all people and hope to work with people of all sorts.
